# my_assignment
Kafka Producer and Consumer using Python language

Already created the Docker images based on this source and pushed into Docker Hub. Latest images available in Dockey hub.

Directly execute the docker-compose.yml file
1. Inside consumer directory docker-compose.yml for both producer and consumer (path: consumer/docker-compose.yml)
2. Outside default docker-compose.yml for only producer job(Reading Json file from that input shared path and produce to Kafka topic)

This is very short and sweet project code without more packages and others.

Used Direct Stream , Lambda function and RDD without any DF and Datastream
